Abstract
The paper builds upon the foundational knowledge of propositional logic and proof systems introduced in the course. The authors discuss:

The components of a proof system: formal language, deduction rules, and axioms.
The use of a Hilbert-style proof system to syntactically prove formulas and establish properties such as Soundness and Completeness.
Sequent Calculus is formally introduced as an alternative proof system, with an emphasis on:

Defining its building blocks: formal language, axioms, and inference rules.
Demonstrating metatheorems about the system.
Comparing its features and applications with the Hilbert-style system.
Key Topics
Formal Language: The syntactical framework for constructing formulas in Sequent Calculus.
Axioms and Inference Rules: Rules for generating new formulas and constructing proofs.
Metatheorems: Analysis of properties such as Soundness, Completeness, and Cut-Elimination.
Comparison: Evaluation of Sequent Calculus vs. Hilbert-style proof systems.
Applications: Practical and theoretical uses of Sequent Calculus in logic and mathematics.
Purpose
This paper aims to:

Provide a structured introduction to Sequent Calculus for students and researchers.
Offer a comparative perspective on different proof systems.
Serve as a resource for exploring applications of proof systems in formal logic.
